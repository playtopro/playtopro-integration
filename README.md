## 🔧 Configuration

### Automatic Discovery (Recommended)

If your Playtopro device is on the same network, it can be discovered automatically.

**Before starting:**

- Ensure the device is in **setup mode**
- The **mode LED must be flashing**
- To enter setup mode:
    1. Press and hold the **Mode** button for **2 seconds**
    2. Release the button
    3. The device will reboot into setup mode

**Add the device in Home Assistant:**

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. A notification will appear: **“Discovered Playtopro device”**
3. Click **Add**
4. Review the detected details and confirm

The device will be added automatically.

**After setup is complete:**

- Exit setup mode by pressing and holding the **Mode** button for **2 seconds**
- Release the button and allow the device to reboot
- The mode LED will remain **on**, indicating normal operation


**Add the Playtopro Card to Your Dashboard:**

The integration includes a custom Lovelace card. Home Assistant registers it automatically.

To add it to a dashboard:

Go to Overview

Click ⋮ → Edit dashboard

Click Add card

Select By Card

Search for Playtopro

Select Playtopro Device Card

Choose your Playtopro device from the drop down and click save

That’s it — the card will appear and update automatically.

### Manual Setup

If automatic discovery does not work, you can add the device manually:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for **Playtopro**
4. Enter the following details:
    - **Host** – Device IP address
    - **Port** – Device port
    - **Serial number** – Printed on the device label
5. Complete the setup wizard

---

## ⚙️ Options

After initial setup, Zeroconf will automatically update the device IP address if it changes.

You can also manually update connection details:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**
2. Find **Playtopro**
3. Click **Configure**
4. Update:
    - **Host**
    - **Port**

All changes are validated before being applied.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Devices are identified by their **serial number**
- Zeroconf discovery keeps the IP address up to date automatically
- Each physical device maps to a **single Home Assistant device**
- All entities are grouped under the correct device

---

## 🌐 Network Requirements

- The Playtopro device and Home Assistant must be on the **same local network** for Zeroconf discovery
- **Remote access** is possible with appropriate NAT and port‑forwarding configuration
