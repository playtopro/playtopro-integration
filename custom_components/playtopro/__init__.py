"""The lichen playtopro integration."""

# To validate the integration, run:
# python3 -m script.hassfest --integration-path ./components/playtopro
# You have to set your target level in your manifest.json.
# To bypass the check so your integration will load, first set:
# "quality_scale":"internal"
# Then, tell home assistant to bypass the check.
# Locate script/hassfest/quality_scale.py
# Locate INTEGRATIONS_WITHOUT_SCALE, and add the domain name - playtopro.
# To confirm, rerun the following can you should get a pass:
# python3 -m script.hassfest --integration-path ./homeassistant/components/playtopro
# NOTE you must run this from the hacore folder.
# Finally, to have your integration included, run:
# python3 -m script.hassfest
# NOTE you must run this from the hacore folder.
# To confirm that your integration in now available, check:
# /workspaces/hacore/homeassistant/generated/config_flows.py
# Your integratioin should appear in the list of integrations.
# If you have imported your files using docker desktop, you need to adjust the
# file permissions to allow the scripts to read the files.
# You can do this by running:
# sudo chown -R vscode ./playtopro
